                Life is a beautiful gift by God to us. ...
                 Many of us don't understand the importance 
                 of Life and thus spend most of our lives in regret.
                  Life is not all about pain and regret, but about the
                   experiences and learnings, we have. The best thing about 
                   Life is that it keeps moving forward.
