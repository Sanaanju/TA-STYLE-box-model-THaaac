![Box Model Exercise 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suraj122/AC-STYLE-images/master/box-model/ex-6.png)

#### Problems for exercise 2 in the layout

- Each parent container has width of 600px and border of 1px;
- Each children box has width 180px and height 100px as well as margin of 10px;
- Each child box which is having border has border-width 1px.
- Note in the first container the boxes do not have any border.

- Using CSS resets is necessary.
- Use semantic tags and keep the nesting and indentation proper.
